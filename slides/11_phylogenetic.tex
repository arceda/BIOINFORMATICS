	\begin{block}{What is evolution?}
		In the biological context, evolution can be defined as the development of a
		biological form from other preexisting forms or its origin to the current existing form
		through natural selections and modifications \cite{xiong2006essential}.

		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Outgroup}.- Which is a sequence that is homologous to the sequences under consideration, but separated from those sequences at an early evolutionary time.

\begin{frame}{Choice of Molecular Markers}{}
	Use nucleotides for:
	\begin{block}{}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Studying very closely related organisms, nucleotide sequences, which
			evolve more rapidly than proteins.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{block}

	Use proteins because:
	\begin{block}{}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Protein sequences are relatively more conserved as a result of the degeneracy of the	genetic code.
			\item Sixty-one codons encode for twenty amino acids, meaning thereby a change in a codon may not result in a change in amino acid.
		\end{itemize}

%-------------------------------------------------------
%-------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Choice of Molecular Markers}{}
	Moreover:
	\begin{block}{}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Protein sequences allow more sensitive alignment than	DNA sequences (20 vs. 4 characters). \pause
			\item Two randomly related DNA sequences can result in up to 50\%
			sequence identity, compared to 10\% for protein sequences. \pause
			\item In the alignment of DNA, gaps almost always cause	frameshift errors. Protein sequences have a higher signal-to-noise ratio. \pause
			\item DNA is informative for closely related sequences. Moreover, if we take into account that  sequences evolve faster at the DNA level.

%-------------------------------------------------------
%-------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Multiple Substitutions}{}
	\begin{block}{}
		After alignment, we need to measure the distance between sequences. A simple measure could be the number of substitutions in a alignment.

%-------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Multiple Substitutions}{Homoplasy}
Substitutions are complex, for example:
	\begin{block}{}
		When $A$ is replace by $C$. The nucleotide may have actually undergone a
		number of intermediate steps to become C, such as $A 	\rightarrow T 	\rightarrow  G 	\rightarrow C$
	\end{block}

\vspace{0.5cm}
Such multiple substitutions obscure the estimation of the true evolutionary distances between sequences. This effect is known as \textbf{homoplasy} \cite{xiong2006essential}.
\end{frame}
%-------------------------------------------------------
%-------------------------------------------------------

%-------------------------------------------------------
%-------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Multiple Substitutions}{Substitution Models}

	\begin{block}{}
		The statistical models used to correct \textbf{homoplasy} are called substitution models or evolutionary models \cite{xiong2006essential}.

\begin{frame}{Substitution Models}{Jukes‚ÄìCantor Model}	
	This model assumes that all nucleotides are substituted with equal probability.

	\begin{equation}
		d_{AB} = -\frac{3}{4} ln \left[  1 - \left( \frac{4}{3} \right) p_{AB}  \right] 
	\end{equation}\\
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	where, $d_{AB}$ is the evolutionary distance between $A$ and $B$. $p_{AB}$, is the observed sequence distance measured by the proportion of substitutions over the entire lenght. \\
\end{frame}
%-------------------------------------------------------
%-------------------------------------------------------

%-------------------------------------------------------
%-------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Substitution Models}{Jukes‚ÄìCantor Model}	
	\textbf{Example}: If an alignment of sequences A and B is twenty nucleotides long and
	six pairs are found to be different, the sequences differ by 30\%, or have an observed

\end{frame}
%-------------------------------------------------------

\begin{frame}{Substitution Models}{Jukes‚ÄìCantor Model}	
	Solution:
	
	\begin{equation*}
	d_{AB} = -\frac{3}{4} ln \left[  1 - \left( \frac{4}{3} \right) p_{AB}  \right] 
	\end{equation*}\\	
	
	$p_{AB} = 0.3$
	
	\begin{equation*}
	d_{AB} = -\frac{3}{4} ln \left[  1 - \left( \frac{4}{3} \right) 0.3  \right]  = 0.38

%-------------------------------------------------------
%-------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Substitution Models}{Kimura Model}	
	This is a more sophisticated model in which mutation rates for transitions	and transversion are assumed to be different.
	
	\begin{equation}
	d_{AB} = -\frac{1}{2} ln (1 -  2p_{ti} - p_{tv} ) - \frac{1}{4}  ln (1 - 2p_{tv} )  
	\end{equation}\\
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	where, $d_{AB}$ is the evolutionary distance between $A$ and $B$. $p_{ti}$, is the observed
	frequency for transition and $p_{tv}$ the frequency of transversion\footnotemark. \\
	
	\footnotetext[1]{Transitions are interchanges of two-ring purines (A  G) or of one-ring pyrimidines (C  T): they therefore involve bases of similar shape. Transversions are interchanges of purine for pyrimidine bases, which therefore involve exchange of one-ring and two-ring structures.}

%-------------------------------------------------------
%-------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Substitution Models}{Kimura Model}	
	\textbf{Example}: The comparison of	sequences A and B differ by 30\%. If 20\% of changes are a result of transitions and 10\% of changes are a result of transversions. What is the distances using Kimura Model?		
\end{frame}
%-------------------------------------------------------
%-------------------------------------------------------

%-------------------------------------------------------
%-------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Substitution Models}{Kimura Model}	
	Solution:
	
	\begin{equation*}
	d_{AB} = -\frac{1}{2} ln (1 -  2p_{ti} - p_{tv} ) - \frac{1}{4}  ln (1 - 2p_{tv} )  
	\end{equation*}\\	

	$p_{ti} = 0.2$ \\
	$p_{tv} = 0.1$ \\
	
	\begin{equation*}
	d_{AB} = -\frac{1}{2} ln (1 -  2*0.2 - 0.1 ) - \frac{1}{4}  ln (1 - 2*0.1 )  = 0.40

\begin{frame}{Substitution Models}{Protein sequences}	
	\begin{block}{}
		For protein sequences, the evolutionary distances from an alignment can be corrected using a PAM or JTT amino acid substitution matrix.
	\end{block}	

	For example, the Kimura model for correcting multiple substitutions in
	protein distances is:
	
	\begin{equation}
	d = -ln (1 - p - 0.2p^2)
	\end{equation}
	
	where, $p$ is the observed pairwise distance between two sequences.

\begin{frame}{Multiple Substitutions}{Among-Site Variations}
	\begin{block}{}
		In all these calculations, different positions in a sequence are assumed to be evolving
		at the same rate. However, this assumption may not hold up in reality.
	\end{block}

	\begin{block}{}
		Nevertheless:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item In DNA sequences, the rates of substitution differ for different codon positions. The	third codon mutates much faster than the other two.	
			\item For protein sequences, some amino acids change much more rarely than others.
		\end{itemize}

	\end{block}

\begin{frame}{Multiple Substitutions}{Among-Site Variations}

		It has been shown that there are always a proportion of positions in a sequence

	Probability curves of $\gamma$ distribution. The mathematical function of the distribution is
	$f(x) + (x^{\gamma-1} e^{-x} )/ \Gamma(\gamma)$. The curves assume different shapes depending on the $\gamma$-shape parameter ($\gamma$).

%-------------------------------------------------------

%-------------------------------------------------------
%-------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Substitution Models}{Among-Site Variations}	
	For the Jukes-Cantor model, the evolution distance can be adjusted:
	
	\begin{equation*}
	d_{AB} = \frac{3}{4} \alpha \left[  1 - \left( \frac{4}{3}   p_{AB} \right)^{-1/\alpha} -1  \right] 
	\end{equation*}\\	
For the Kimura model, the evolutionary distance with $\gamma$ correction factor becomes:

	\begin{equation*}
	d_{AB} = \frac{\alpha}{2} \left[ (1 -  2p_{ti} - p_{tv} )^{-1/\alpha} - \frac{1}{2}  (1 - 2p_{tv} )^{-1/\alpha}  -\frac{1}{2}  \right] 
	\end{equation*}\\	
where $\alpha$ is the $\gamma$ correction factor (default = 1).
