	\begin{block}{What is evolution?}
		In the biological context, evolution can be defined as the development of a
		biological form from other preexisting forms or its origin to the current existing form
		through natural selections and modifications \cite{xiong2006essential}. 		
	\end{block}
\end{frame}
%-------------------------------------------------------
%-------------------------------------------------------

%-------------------------------------------------------
%-------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Phylogenetics}{Definition}
	\begin{block}{}
		\textbf{Phylogenetics} is the study of the evolutionary history of living organisms using tree like diagrams to represent pedigrees of these organisms \cite{xiong2006essential}. 		
	\end{block}

	\begin{block}{}
		\textbf{Molecular phylogenetics} is the study of evolutionary relationships of genes and other biological macromolecules by analyzing mutations at various positions in their sequences \cite{xiong2006essential}. 		
	\end{block}

	Major Assumptions:	
	\begin{block}{}
		\begin{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Rooted and unrooted}{}
	\begin{block}{}
		The root of the tree is not known; the common ancestor is already
		extinct \cite{xiong2006essential}. 		
	\end{block}
	
	\begin{block}{}
		There are two ways to define the root of a tree:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Outgroup}.- Which is a sequence that is homologous to the sequences under consideration, but separated from those sequences at an early evolutionary time.
			\item \textbf{Midpoint rooting approach}.- The midpoint of the two most divergent groups
			judged by overall branch lengths is assigned as the root.
		\end{itemize}

%-------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Gene versus species phylogeny}{}
	\begin{block}{Gene phylogeny}
		Describes the evolution of that particular gene/protein. This sequence
		may evolve more or less rapidly than other genes or may have a different evolutionary history from the rest of the genome \cite{xiong2006essential}. 		
	\end{block}

	\begin{block}{Species phylogeny}
		The species evolution is the combined result of evolution by multiple genes in a genome \cite{xiong2006essential}.

\begin{frame}{The true tree}{}
	\begin{block}{}
		The	search for a correct tree topology can sometimes be extremely difficult and computationally demanding. The number of potential tree topologies can be enormously large even with a moderate number of taxa \cite{xiong2006essential}.		
	\end{block}

	\begin{equation}
		N_R = \frac{( 2n - 3)! }{ 2^{n-2} (n-2)!}
	\end{equation}
	
	\begin{equation}
	N_U = \frac{( 2n - 5)! }{ 2^{n-3} (n-3)!}
	\end{equation}
	where $N_R$ and $N_U$ are the number of rooted and unrooted trees, $n$ is the number of taxa.

%-------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Methodology}{}
	\begin{block}{}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Choice a molecular marker.
			\item Alignment.
			\item Multiple substitution.
			\item Phylogenetics building.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{block}

\subsection{Choice of Molecular Markers}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%-------------------------------------------------------
%-------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Choice of Molecular Markers}{}
	\begin{block}{}
		Nucleotide or protein sequence data?
	\end{block}
\end{frame}
%-------------------------------------------------------
%-------------------------------------------------------

%-------------------------------------------------------
%-------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Choice of Molecular Markers}{}
	Use nucleotides for:
	\begin{block}{}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Studying very closely related organisms, nucleotide sequences, which
			evolve more rapidly than proteins.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{block}

	Use proteins because:
	\begin{block}{}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Protein sequences are relatively more conserved as a result of the degeneracy of the	genetic code.
			\item Sixty-one codons encode for twenty amino acids, meaning thereby a change in a codon may not result in a change in amino acid.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{block}
\end{frame}
%-------------------------------------------------------
%-------------------------------------------------------

%-------------------------------------------------------
%-------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Choice of Molecular Markers}{}
	Moreover:
	\begin{block}{}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Protein sequences allow more sensitive alignment than	DNA sequences (20 vs. 4 characters). \pause
			\item Two randomly related DNA sequences can result in up to 50\%
			sequence identity, compared to 10\% for protein sequences. \pause
			\item In the alignment of DNA, gaps almost always cause	frameshift errors. Protein sequences have a higher signal-to-noise ratio. \pause
			\item DNA is informative for closely related sequences. Moreover, if we take into account that  sequences evolve faster at the DNA level.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{block}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Alignment}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%-------------------------------------------------------
%-------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Alignment}{}
	\begin{block}{}
		Only the correct alignment produces correct phylogenetic.
	\end{block}

	\begin{block}{}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item  In some cases, researchers like to remove all insertions and deletions and only use positions that are shared by all sequences in the dataset. As a consequence, many phylogenetic signals are lost.
			
			\item There is an automatic approach in improving alignment quality. For example: Rascal 	and NorMD
